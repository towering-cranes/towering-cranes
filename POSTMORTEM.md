# What could've gone better? (do some self reflection of your entire project period and give advice to the future thesis groups in terms of behaviors/technologies they should steer away from)

- Michael: The shift in the tech stack from React and MongoDB to Angular and MySQL was a hinder in the workflow from Greenfield to Legacy. Configuring 0Auth 2.0 was also a learning curve. Being patient and spending more time doing research on any new technologies you know you will be facing is important in order to maximize productivity for when the actual coding process begins.
